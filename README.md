# splitty
An app I'm making to help people (mainly college students) split bills easily in groups.

## Remaining Features
- [ ] **Total Calculation**: The working list should have a footer view that shows the current subtotal of the list, along with a button to save it.
- [ ] **Saveable Lists**: Users should be able to save the list they're working on when they're done with it. When they save it, they should be able to give it a name, and the list, along with its name, should show up in the "Past Splits" tab.
- [ ] **Editable Items**: Users should be able to click on an item in the current list to view its details and edit it.
- [ ] **Details for Past Splits**: When users are looking at their past splits, they should be able to click on one to see the items in it.
- [ ] **Empty States**: Table views should show some kind of message (and in some cases, a button) when they have no content to display. This should also apply to the list of people that's shown in `AddItemManuallyViewController`.
